# Heart_disease_prediction
Analysis on a pre-prosessed dataset of cleveland predicting the heart disease presence and scailing the intensity.
To understand Dataset More Clearly, we have the following Information.
1.	Age: Between 35 to 75.
2.	Sex:  1 = male and 0 = female.
3.	CP :
Value 1 = typical angina
Value 2 = atypical angina
Value 3 = non  angina pain
Value 4 = asymptotic
4.	Trestbps – (resting blood pressure)
5.	chol: serum cholesterol
6.fbs : If fasting blood sugar > 120mg/dl then : 1 =true
        else : 0 = false.
    7. restecg :  0 = normal
                    1 = having ST-T wave abnormality
                    2 = left ventricular hyperthrophy
8: thalach: maximum heart rate achieved.
9. exang: 1 = yes  and 0 = no
10. Oldpeak : ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest: 
11.Slope : 
                   1 = upsloping
                   2 = flat
                   3 = downsloping
12.ca: Number of major vessels (0–3) colored by flourosopy.
13.Thal :  3 = normal
                6 = fixed defect 
                7 = reversible defect
14.Diagnosis of heart disease :  0 = absence
1, 2, 3, 4 = present.
